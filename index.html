    <h1>Hi! This is Rein Henrichs&rsquo;s resume.</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      I am a kind and considerate <b>technical leader</b>, <b>coach</b>, <b>mentor</b>, <b>software developer</b>, <b><a
          href="http://resiliencepapers.club/">resilience engineer</a></b>, and <b>teammate</b>. I am a good listener
      and an effective communicator. I believe that most technical problems problems can be solved by listening, caring,
      and empoweringd helping people overcome difficult technical challenges (which usually involves helping people work
      better together). I also wrote a database in Haskell once, so I have that going for me, which is&nbsp;nice.
